# Docker_Compose_Multi_Container_Tool
### Our containers will often require other containers such as SQL or a key value. And other applications that we'll need to run in containers, like procies or web frontends or backend workers, and so on. What if we had a way to connect all those pieces of our solution together, where we did't need to remember all of our docker rn options, and then get them into discreet, virtual networks with relationships between them, and only expose the public ports, and then spin them all up and tear them down with one command. This is Docker Compose.
